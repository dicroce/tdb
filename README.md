tdb is a work in progress consisting of various components useful for creating a database. Currently, the most useful component here is probably the b_tree.

### Goals

A tdb database will ultimately consist of a number of files. Users of tdb can hopefully pick and choose the components they want to use.

#### Log Structured Storage
#### Lazy Remove
